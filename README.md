# UpliftBot
A simple chatbot for the UpliftBot Facebook Page.  Created with Python, Flask, pymessenger, and hosted via Microsoft Azure.

## What does the app do?
When users send a message to 'UpliftBot' via Facebook Messenging, this web app responds with an uplifting response. The responses are randomly selected from a list. In future versions I'd like to add some machine learning capability to the response generator, but for now the main aim is to create a basic framework to play around with.
